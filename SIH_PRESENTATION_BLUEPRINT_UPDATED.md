**Title:** BioMapper
**Subtitle:** The Complete AI-Powered Biodiversity Intelligence Ecosystem
**Team:** Aln't Working | **Problem Statement:** 25042

**Opening Line (The New Hook):**
*"Good morning. While traditional labs take weeks to analyze a single sample, our platform processes hundreds in real-time, predicts ecosystem threats, estimates conservation costs, and generates policy recommendations - all from a single DNA sample. We are Team Aln't Working, and this is BioMapper: The world's first complete biodiversity intelligence ecosystem."*
